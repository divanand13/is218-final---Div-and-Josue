2. SWOT Analysis

Introduction

After analyzing our three competitors we want to do a SWOT analysis on our donut business by implementing certain archetypes and methods of persuasion to make our business more competitive. 

	Strength - Being college students opening a new donut business in the area can give us a strong initial set of customers
	Weakness - Being that we are a new donut business we would lack Liking and Consus (Social proof) as methods of persuasion. 
	Opportunities: There is a market opportunity in the area for gourmet donut places. There isnâ€™t a Krispy Kreme on campus, and Dunkin Donuts offers a variety of food which lessers the quality of their donuts 
	Threats: There are already extremely established donut franchises in the U.S. with Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme. It will be difficult to break in and make a successful donut franchise with these giants already in play.
